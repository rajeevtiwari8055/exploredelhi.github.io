<h2>Travel Tips</h2>
<p style="color:#1a1a1a;">Best time to visit Delhi: October to March, when the weather is pleasant and sightseeing is comfortable.
                Travel around the city efficiently by using the Delhi Metro — fast, clean, and safe.
                Carry some cash for local markets and street shopping, as digital payments may not always work.
                Stay hydrated, especially in the scorching summer months, and wear comfortable clothing.
                Plan your days well to cover historical sites, markets, and cultural spots without rushing.</p>
